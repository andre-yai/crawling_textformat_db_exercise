Crawling and text format exercise

#Crawling
I did it in NodeJs. 

I used cherrio  to crawl the reddit website and request to get the webpage. 

To call to crawl and get the top threads: 
node crawling cat askReddit
You should use space between the subReddits.

## Telegram Part 

And for telegram bot I used the telegram bot the node-telegram-bot-api bot. To use it you must first create a bot on telegram and get the access token provided and insert into the code.

To run:

node telegram_bot.js or node start

To call the task you should type in the conversation:

\NadaPraFazer cats;askReddit

Attention: you should use ';' as the example above.
